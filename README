  This repo provides some Vagrant/Puppet manifests that automatically install
  and configure some simple EPICS IOCs in a Virtual Machine. The IOCs are
  primarily intended for integration testing of pvmanager.

Software requirements:

  Virtual Box
  Vagrant
  Git
  Puppet
  librarian-puppet

Run the following commands to bring up the virtual machine:

  > librarian-puppet install
  > vagrant up

  Note for Windows users: Run

  > git config --global core.autocrlf false

  before checking out the Git repositories. Otherwise Git will convert Unix
  line breaks (LF) to CR+LF. This will break init scripts etc.!
